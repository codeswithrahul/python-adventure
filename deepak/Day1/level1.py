# 1. Write a program to Swap two Variables a and b (Swapping basically means interchanging)
# a = 5
# b = 6

# def swap(a,b):
#     c = a + b
#     a = c - a
#     b = c - b
#     return a,b
    
# print(swap(a,b))

# --------------------------------------------------------------------

# 2. Write a program to print the largest of the three numbers.
# a = 4
# b = 61
# c = 13

# def largestThreeNumber(a,b,c):
#     if a > b and a > c:
#         return a
#     elif b > c:
#         return b
#     else:
#         return c

# print(largestThreeNumber(a,b,c))

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


#3. Write a program to assume a value of marks and print whether a person has failed or passed
# If Marks >=40 --> pass

# marks = 38

# def failOrPass(m):
#     if m>=40:
#         print('pass')    # def swap(a,b):
#     c = a + b
#     a = c - a
#     b = c - b
#     return a,b
#     else:
#         print("fail")

# print(failOrPass(marks))


# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



# 4. Design a program to assign grades to students based on the following criteria:

#  - Students scoring less than or equal to 50 should be awarded a "D" grade.

#  - Students scoring above 50 but below 60 should receive a "C" grade.

#  - Students with marks between 60 to 75 should be assigned a "B" grade.

#  - Students scoring greater than 75 should be granted an "A" grade.


#  Example:

#  Suppose the program is given the following student scores:

#  45

#  58

#  70

#  80

#  The program should output the corresponding grades for each student:

#  D

#  C

#  B

#  A
